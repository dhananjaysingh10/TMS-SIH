def classify_ticket(ticket: dict) -> ClassificationOutput:
    
    prompt = f"""You are an expert IT Service Management classifier for a large technology company.

**Ticket Details:**
- ID: {ticket.get('ticketId', 'N/A')}
- Title: {ticket.get('title', 'N/A')}
- Description: {ticket['description']}
- Submitted By: {ticket.get('createdBy', 'N/A')}

**Task:**
Analyze this ticket and provide accurate classification with:

1. **department** - Choose ONE from:
   - IT: General IT support, helpdesk, hardware/software issues, user accounts, email, printers, laptops
   - DevOps: CI/CD pipelines, deployments, infrastructure as code, container orchestration, automation
   - Software: Application bugs, feature requests, code issues, API problems, frontend/backend development
   - Networking: Network connectivity, VPN, firewalls, routers, switches, DNS, DHCP, bandwidth issues
   - Cybersecurity: Security incidents, vulnerabilities, access control, malware, data breaches, compliance
   - Other: Tickets that don't fit above categories

2. **type** - Choose ONE from:
   - bug: Something broken or not working correctly
   - feature: Request for new functionality
   - task: Work to be done (setup, configuration, maintenance)
   - improvement: Enhancement to existing functionality
   - support: Help needed with using existing systems

3. **priority** - Choose ONE based on urgency and impact:
   - low: Minor issue, no significant impact, can wait days/weeks
   - medium: Normal priority, moderate impact, should be addressed in 1-3 days
   - high: Important issue affecting productivity, needs attention within hours
   - urgent: Critical issue, system down, blocking work, needs immediate attention

4. **confidence**: Float 0.0-1.0 indicating your certainty in this classification

5. **suggested_actions**: Array of 2-5 specific next steps for the assigned team

**Classification Guidelines:**

**IT Department:**
- Password resets, account lockouts
- Hardware failures (laptop, mouse, keyboard)
- Software installation requests
- Email configuration issues
- Printer problems
- General user support

**DevOps:**
- Build failures, deployment issues
- Docker/Kubernetes problems
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Infrastructure provisioning
- Monitoring and alerting setup
- Server automation

**Software:**
- Application crashes or errors
- API integration issues
- Database query problems
- UI/UX bugs
- Performance optimization
- Code review requests

**Networking:**
- Cannot connect to network/VPN
- Slow network speed
- DNS resolution failures
- Port forwarding requests
- Network equipment configuration
- WiFi connectivity issues

**Cybersecurity:**
- Suspicious activity detected
- Security vulnerability reports
- Access control modifications
- Compliance requirements
- Security policy violations
- Phishing attempts

**Priority Rules:**
- "urgent" keywords: down, critical, production, blocking, emergency, ASAP
- "high" keywords: broken, not working, affecting multiple users, deadline
- "medium" keywords: intermittent, slow, occasionally, need help
- "low" keywords: question, clarification, nice to have, future

Provide accurate, context-aware classification."""
